# Pseudo code for self-attention mechanism

# Step 1: Define the input sequence
# Step 1.1 Define the dimensions for the query, key and value vectors
# Step 2: Create the query, key and value matrices
# Step 3: Compute the dot product of the query with all keys to get the attention scores
# Step 4: Scale the attention scores by dividing by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors
# Step 5: Apply the softmax function to get the attention weights
# Step 6: Multiply the attention weights with the value vectors to get the output of the self-attention mechanism
# Step 7: Optionally, apply a linear transformation to the output of the self-attention mechanism to get the final output
